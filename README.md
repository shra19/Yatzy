#Description
Yatzy is a popular dice game that can be played either alone or with friends. The game is played over 15 turns, each with different rules, or categories, for scoring. Each turn is played in the same way, starting with the first player rolling the five available dice. The player then chose any number of dice to keep in such a way that they maximize their chance for a high score given this turns scoring rules, and re-roll the rest. This process is repeated once for up to a total of three rolls and two keeps. Once the player either keep all the dice or has rolled three times their score for this turn is noted down on the score pad and the next player play their turn. Should the player fail to fulfill the combination of dice needed for the current category, a score of 0 is achieved for that category. When all players have played the turn, the first player starts the next turn. This is done until all turns has been played, after which each players' total score is calculated. The player with the highest total score win.

Implementation Details
The scoring pad is to be implemented with a dictionary containing each category and a score associated to the category.
The die is to be implemented using a generator.
Each category is to be implemented using a separate function (one function/category)
The player is to be implemented using a named tuple containing the player’s name, scoring pad, and the five dice they are to use.
The game is to be implemented according to the following flow:
Players are added through input by the user until a user input ‘start’
The order of the players is shuffled
Until all categories on the scoring pad are filled:
Present the current category (as ordered above)
Roll the player’s dice
Let the player chose what dice to keep
Let the player reroll if not all dice are kept
Let the player chose what dice to keep
Let the player reroll if not all dice are kept
Calculate the score according to the rules of the category
If more than one choice can be made, automatically chose the highest scoring choice
If no choice can be made, put 0 as score
Repeat for each player
Calculate the total score for all players
Sort the players in descending order, presenting the winner first and the player with least point last
